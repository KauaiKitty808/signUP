Learning with Angela Yu, Newsletter Form & collection using Mailchimp as NewsletterApp but our own form using API.  using express, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, BS5, API etc 

This is part/exercise of the class, The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp I am doing.
This code works and but it wont work out of the box, you will have to add your own
Mailchimp API Key (API_KEY_MC), Audience Key/ListID (LIST_ID_MC) in a .env file 

I shared with the class this, in case you come from Angela Yu 2023 class too and 
have to deal wth some outdated parts... here a text I shared with the community 
about the API / Mailchimp hurdels

#hosting & #MailshimpAPI 

  Suggestion: UPDADTE THAT SECTION PRIORETY -- Since Heroku not offers free service anymore, we gotta look for different which often includes understanding GitHub stuff and for me also safety to consider. 

I found https://app.cyclic.sh/#/join/KauaiKitty808 as a free account alternative for using express/node.js, and I had for that upload the MailChimp newsletter files onto git hub res  first time ever doing that.. That caused that I got my API revoked bcs uploaded it with the git hub with the code - upps, and at this point have NOT LEARNED YET about the safety, dotenv(.env) and why and how to hide sensitive data like API _Keys etc.. (well of cause makes sense...  hehe and now I have) but to take frustration out of the class for bare beginners would be good to have this section priorities for UPDATES.

And meanwhile for everyone else, I here I learned how to hide sensitive Information like API keys, Database credentials or or 
HOW TO HIDE API KEYS: https://monsterlessons-academy.com/posts/how-to-hide-api-keys-with-node-js

So extract your API key with dotenv (.env) , and do NOT upload the Key directly in code or even as .env  ever to Github (also learn about gitignore.
With cyclic it found the missing .env enviromant variables automatic and asked me, so I entered the keys into cyclic .env safe directly in a form where all the "secret" info's stored .
